\section{Team Members}

In this session we introduce our group members in no particular order.

\subsection{Yulin Zhang}

\textbf{Name}: Yulin Zhang

\textbf{SID}: 40264421

\textbf{Program}:Meng. Electrical and Computer Engineering

\textbf{Email}: silveralex2023820@gmail.com

\textbf{SE Background}: I specialize in computer graphics algorithms, game development, and software architecture, and I am good at C++ and Python. I used to work as a game engine programmer in Netease for 2.5 years, focusing on graphics algorithm development, such as real-time global illumination algorithms. I also have research experience in ultrasonic image diagnosis by deep learning and have published two SCI papers. I am eager to dedicate myself to the video game industry in Montreal.

\section{Development Tools}

In this session we introduce the tools used in the project development.


\subsection{Version Control}

We use \textbf{Git} as our version control tool. The graphics interface of Git makes it easy to control the project version. We have built a repository on GitHub for our group, which ensures the steady advancement of our project.

In summary, our version control tool is \textbf{Git}.
 
\subsection{Programming Languages}

The project can be divided into two parts: front-end and back-end. As for the front-end, we use \textbf{HTML} to create the web page and \textbf{Javascript} to control the behavior of web pages. As for the back-end, we use \textbf{Python} to process the analysis logic. Python is a powerful language, which has a lot of development frameworks for us to boost our project progress, such as Flask. 

In summary, we will use \textbf{HTML}, \textbf{Javascript}, and \textbf{Python} in this project.

\subsection{IDE \& Development Tools}

Based on the languages we used in this project, we have chosen \textbf{Pycharm} as our main IDE to develop a Python back-end program.
 As for the database, we chose \textbf{MongoDB} for the data storage. Meanwhile, We decided to build up the project based on \textbf{Flask} framework.
 
 
 In summary, \textbf{Pycharm} is our main IDE, and we will develop the project based on \textbf{MongoDB} and \textbf{Flask}.
 

\subsection{Group Communication Software}

We communicate with each other by \textbf{Wechat}. We are familiar with the usage of this app, and we have built up a development group for our communication.

In summary, we use \textbf{Wechat} as our group communication software.

\subsection{Tracking Tools}

Because we are a small group and have the requirement of swift development. We chose \textbf{Monday} (https://monday.com/) as our tracking tool to advance our project. Monday is suitable for small development groups, we can create an event easily.

In summary, we use \textbf{Monday} as our tracking tool.
